// A game record being edited: the SGF tree, where in it the editor is, and
// every change the editor can make to it. Still no window and no drawing --
// the board and the side panel read this and call into it.
//
// What the properties mean lives here. A move is B[] or W[]; stones set up are
// AB/AW/AE; marks are TR, SQ, CR, MA, SL, TB, TW, DD, labels LB, arrows and
// lines AR and LN; the comment is C. Everything else in a node is carried
// along untouched.
//
// Every edit is one undo step, and an edit that would leave the record
// broken is refused, with the reason, rather than made.
//
// Two edits go beyond what a recorder normally offers, because a game copied
// down by hand is rarely copied down right first time:
//
//   moveStone()   A stone on the board can be picked up and put somewhere
//                 else, and the move that played it is changed -- however many
//                 moves ago that was. Everything after it is played out again
//                 on top, so captures come out as they now would.
//
//   insertMove()  A move is put in after the current one, with everything that
//                 followed hanging on after it, rather than starting a new
//                 variation. Two of these put back an exchange that was left
//                 out.
//
// Both check the whole of the record after the change, variations included,
// and are refused if any later move would land on a stone.
