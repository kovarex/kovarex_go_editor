// The Controls page: which keys do what, and changing them.
//
// Built the way Factorio's ControlSettingsGui is, less what a Go editor has
// no use for (collapsing the sections, the controller, the search): a deep
// panel under a subheader with the red reset button, and in it a section per
// group of controls, each a table of rows -- the control's name, then its
// primary and alternative keys on two buttons. Clicking a button waits for
// the keys to put on it ("Waiting"); right-clicking clears it ("Not set").
// Keys that another control has too show in red.
//
// Like the Settings page, it edits a draft, taken when it opens, that only
// Confirm keeps; the reset button and Back light up what they would change.
//
// The page can't read the keys itself: the App reads the keyboard ahead of
// the Gui, and while the page is waiting() hands it the keys pressed.
